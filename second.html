        <p>Teachers help students find important things they've lost everyday.
            Sometimes it is a paper , backpack , or jacket......
            other times it is courage , confidence or a smile.
             For me friends also do the same.Happy friendship day ma'am.
              I am blessed to have a teacher cum friend in this journey of learning</p>
